    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>

            <li>B1 can (14-16oz) black beans, drained</li>
            <li>8 Eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup feta cheese, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>Pico de Gallo or botteld salsa</li>
            <li>Sliced Avocado (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
            <li>Hot sauce</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
        </ul> <br>
    <strong>Preperation: </strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Pulse the black beans, lime juice, cumin, and a few shakes of hot sauce in a food processor until it has the consistency of refried beans, adding a bit of water to help if necessary.            </li>
            <li>Coat a small nonstick pan with nonstick cooking spray or a bit of butter or olive oil and heat over medium heat.            </li>
            <li>Crack two eggs into a bowl and beat with a bit of salt and pepper.            </li>
            <li>Add the eggs to the pan, then use a spatula to stir and then lift the cooked egg on the bottom to allow raw egg to slide under.            </li>
            <li>When the eggs have all but set, spoon a quarter of the black bean mixture and 2 tablespoons feta down the middle of the omelet.</li>
            <li>Use the spatula to fold over a third of the egg to cover the mixture in the center, then carefully slide the omelet onto a plate, using the spatula flip it over at the last second to form one fully rolled omelet.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make four omelets. Garnish with pico de gallo, avocado slices if you like, and bit more crumbled feta.</li>
        </ol>
