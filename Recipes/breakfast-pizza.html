    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Start with the ultimate breakfast bread—the fiber-dense whole-wheat English muffin—as your base and salsa as 
        your sauce, then add eggs, ham, and cheese for flavor, substance, and plenty of protein.

               <li>Remove the pan from the heat about 30 seconds before the eggs are fully done (they'll continue to cook in the pan and in the oven).</li>

               <li>Divide the eggs among the English muffins, then top with the cheese</li>
               <li>Place all the English muffins on a baking sheet and broil (6" from the heat is ideal) until the cheese is fully melted and browned around the edges.</li>
